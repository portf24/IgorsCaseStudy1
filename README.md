## Project:
### Chicago Cyclistic Case Study
#### Exploring: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?
##### The goal of this analysis was to find marketing strategies for increasing the number of annual memberships.
##### This task involved analyzing differences and trends in bike usage between members and casual riders, focusing on the number of trips, trip duration, and price. R programming was used to visualize these trends with ggplot() and percentile-based analyses to highlight key insights.
- For the project, I utilized RStudio for data cleaning, aggregation, statistical analysis, and visualization, while Excel, including PivotTables and charts, was employed for data observation, additional research, and visualization tasks.
